# Introduction to Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning

I took this course in my masters at HSG as part of my Data Science specialication. This repository included notebooks from this course.

## Key Topics Covered
1. **Machine Learning Fundamentals**: Gain a strong foundation in traditional supervised and unsupervised machine learning concepts and algorithms.

2. **Modern Learning Setups**: Explore advanced learning setups like representation learning, self-supervised learning, adversarial learning, and reinforcement learning.

3. **Python Programming and Implementation**: Develop coding expertise in Python through self-study and practical exercises. Apply machine learning methods to real-world problems.
